						<img src="img/Haikyuu.jpg" alt="Haikyuu" height="509" width="905" />
						<p>
							Haikyuu!! is widely considered one of the best sports anime of all
							time due to its phenomenal character development.<br />
							It gives meaningful arcs to not just the main duo but the entire
							cast, including rival teams. The show is amazing at <br />building
							hype and tension during its realistic volleyball matches while
							maintaining an incredibly positive and uplifting <br />
							tone about teamwork and self-improvement.
						</p>

						<details>
							<summary>
								Trivia: The author, Haruichi Furudate, gave the two main
								characters, Hinata and Kageyama, names that create a contrasting
								<br />
								theme. What is this theme?
							</summary>
							<p>
								Their names relate to "light and shadow." Hinata (日向) contains
								the character for "sun" or "daylight," while Kageyama (影山)
								contains the character for "shadow."

							height="509"
							width="905"

						<p>
							This is a beautiful and heartbreaking anime known for its powerful
							emotional storytelling. It's a story of overcoming <br />
							trauma through music and human connection. The series is
							celebrated for its stunning, vibrant animation, especially <br />
							during the classical music performances, and its ability to weave
							a deeply moving narrative that is both tragic and hopeful.

					<dd>
						<img
							src="img/blue-lock.jpg"
							alt="Blue Lock"
							height="509"
							width="905"
						/>
						<p>
							Blue Lock completely subverts the traditional sports anime.
							Instead of focusing on teamwork, its premise <br />is a "battle
							royale" to create the world's greatest "egoist" striker. It excels
							in its unique, hyper-individualistic <br />philosophy, its intense
							and dynamic art style, and the psychological pressure that makes
							it feel as much <br />like a thriller as a sports show.
						</p>
						<details>
							<summary>
								Trivia: The unique, hexagonal-pentagonal design of the rooms and
								fields inside the Blue Lock facility is based on what real-world
								object?
							</summary>
							<p>The pattern of a traditional soccer ball.</p>

							width="905"
						/>
						<p>
							A legendary series in the racing genre, Initial D is beloved for
							its technical accuracy regarding Japanese car <br />culture and
							drifting techniques. Its biggest strengths are the incredibly
							tense and exciting street races <br />and its iconic, high-energy
							Eurobeat soundtrack that has become synonymous with the anime
							itself.

							<summary>
								Trivia: What is the real-world nickname for Takumi Fujiwara's
								iconic car, the Toyota Sprinter Trueno AE86, which is also used

						<img

							alt="Fragrant Flower"
							height="509"
							width="905"
						/>
						<p>
							This story is praised for being an incredibly sweet and wholesome
							romance. It subverts typical <br />high school tropes by focusing
							on the genuine, respectful relationship between a boy perceived as
							a <br />delinquent and a girl from an elite school. Its charm lies
							in its lack of unnecessary drama and its focus <br />on mutual
							understanding and the characters' efforts to better themselves for
							each other.
						</p>
						<details>
							<summary>
								Trivia: The two main high schools in the story, Chidori High and
								Kikyo High, are named after flowers. What flowers do they
								represent?

								orchid, while Kikyo is the Japanese name for the Bellflower.

							width="905"
						/>
						<p>
							Bleach is a cornerstone of battle shounen anime, celebrated for
							its iconic character designs and <br />unparalleled sense of
							style. Its strengths are its creative world-building centered
							around Soul Reapers <br />and the afterlife, and its epic,
							visually impressive sword fights. The "Soul Society" arc, in
							particular, <br />is hailed as one of the best arcs in the genre's
							history.
						</p>
						<details>
							<summary>
								Trivia: In Tite Kubo's initial concept for the series, Rukia

						<p>
							This anime is a masterpiece of strategy and mind games. It
							features a brilliant anti-hero protagonist <br />who wages war
							against a global superpower using his intellect and a supernatural
							ability. The show <br />is famous for its fast-paced, thrilling
							plot full of shocking twists, its exploration of complex moral
							<br />and political questions, and its strategic "mecha" battles
							that feel more like high-stakes chess matches.
						</p>
						<details>
							<summary>
								Trivia: What real-world fast-food chain is famously and
								frequently featured throughout Code Geass due to a prominent
								product placement deal?

							height="509"
							width="905"
						/>
						<p>
							Considered one of the best time-travel stories ever told,
							Steins;Gate is exceptional for its intelligent,
							<br />character-driven science fiction. It begins as a slow-burn
							slice-of-life that makes you deeply care about the cast
							<br />before transforming into a gripping psychological thriller.
							The show's handling of the consequences <br />
							and paradoxes of changing the past is both brilliant and
							emotionally devastating.
						</p>
						<details>

					<dd>
						<img src="img/AoT.jpg" alt="AOT" height="509" width="905" />
						<p>
							AOT is renowned for its intricate world-building and profound
							mystery. It starts as a desperate, <br />post-apocalyptic struggle
							for survival and evolves into a complex story about war, freedom,
							and <br />
							the cyclical nature of hatred. Its strengths lie in its intense,
							high-stakes action, jaw-dropping plot twists,<br />
							and deep exploration of moral ambiguity, where the lines between
							hero and villain constantly blur.
						</p>
						<details>
							<summary>
								The design of the towns within the walls, like the Shiganshina
								District, is heavily inspired by a real-life medieval <br />town
								in Germany that is famous for having a completely intact city
								wall. What is the name of this town?

							alt="Haikyuu"
							height="509"
							width="905"
						/>
						<p>
							This series is a masterclass in psychological deconstruction of
							the "transported to another world" genre. <br />
							Instead of being an overpowered hero, the main character is
							exceptionally weak, with his only power being <br />the ability to
							"Return by Death" to a previous checkpoint. The show excels in its
							raw and realistic portrayal <br />of trauma, suffering, and a
							character's slow, painful growth in the face of despair.
						</p>
						<details>
							<summary>
								Trivia: The name of Subaru's powerful but devastating ability,
								"Return by Death," was originally different in the
								<br />author's web novel drafts. What was it called?
							</summary>
							<p>
								It was initially called "Resets," which is a more direct video
								game term.
